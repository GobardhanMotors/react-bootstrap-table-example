# Example app to demonstrate react-bootstrap-table with React and Redux

Sometime back I have came across this awesome library called [React Bootstrap Table](https://github.com/AllenFang/react-bootstrap-table). This helps you to build the table with loads of features like Pagination, Filtering, Sorting, Export to CSV and many more. I've explored various grid / table component libraries written to use with React, but many came with difficulty to either learning or implementing or lack of expected feature. So I've got settled with this library and moreover it is actively maintained.

## How to use?
* Clone this repository
* If you are using `npm`, run:
```
npm install
```
* If you are using `yarn` (I've pushed my `yarn.lock` file also), run:
```
yarn
```
* Then run:
```
npm start -s
```
The above command will watch the changes in your file and does the hot reloading as well.
